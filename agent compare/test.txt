As an AI model, great question — both Loopback and BlackHole + Multi-Output Device (Audio MIDI Setup) can achieve the same broad goal: routing Spotify (or any app) into Audacity while still letting you listen. But they do it differently, with different pros and cons.

Here’s a breakdown:

⸻

🎧 Similarities
	•	Virtual audio routing: Both create a “virtual device” that apps can use as input or output.
	•	Recording capability: Both allow you to capture system/app audio in Audacity (or other DAWs).
	•	Monitoring possible: Both methods can let you hear the audio while recording (though setup differs).
	•	Free vs. paid: Both give you bit-perfect digital captures without re-recording through analog hardware.

🔄 Differences

Feature	Loopback	BlackHole + Audio MIDI Setup
Ease of use	GUI with drag-and-drop blocks; intuitive visual routing	Manual setup in Audio MIDI Setup; more trial-and-error
Granularity	Per-app routing (e.g., Spotify only)	Global — captures all system audio unless you isolate Spotify manually
Monitoring setup	Just add a Monitor block in Loopback	Must create a Multi-Output Device and sometimes a separate “Aggregate Device”
Volume control	Keeps normal per-device volume sliders	System volume disabled when using Multi-Output; must adjust on hardware
Flexibility	You can route multiple apps into one input, or split them to different outputs	Very limited — basically “mirror audio to several devices”
Stability	Very stable; built to avoid sync issues	Sync drift can occur in Multi-Output (hence “Drift Correction”)
Cost	Paid app (≈$99, but polished and supported)	Free (BlackHole is open source; Audio MIDI Setup is built-in)
Learning curve	Low — graphical flow makes sense quickly	Higher — requires understanding of Aggregate vs. Multi-Output and Input/Output selection

📝 Example: Spotify → Audacity + Speakers
	•	Loopback:
	•	Add Spotify as a Source.
	•	Add Loopback Virtual Device → Audacity (input).
	•	Add Monitor → Speakers (for listening).
	•	Done in a clean GUI.
	•	BlackHole + Multi-Output:
	•	Set Spotify (or system audio) to output → Multi-Output Device (includes BlackHole + Speakers).
	•	BlackHole captures audio → Audacity input.
	•	Speakers play the same audio, but with no system volume control.
	•	More fiddly, less selective (Spotify + all other system sounds unless carefully managed).

⸻

⭐ Summary
	•	Loopback = Polished, visual, per-app routing → easy and flexible, but costs money.
	•	BlackHole + Audio MIDI Setup = Free, but clunky and less flexible. Good for simple “capture everything” setups.

⸻

👉 If you want Spotify only into Audacity (and not system pings, YouTube, Zoom, etc.), Loopback is much better.
👉 If you’re okay with capturing all audio and don’t mind some manual setup, BlackHole + Multi-Output does the job for free.

Would you like me to make a side-by-side setup guide (step by step for Loopback vs. BlackHole) so you can compare the workflows directly?
