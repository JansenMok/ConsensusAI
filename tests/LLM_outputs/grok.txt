The engine is significantly heavier than the gasoline in a car. A typical car engine weighs between 300 to 700 pounds (136 to 318 kg), depending on the type and size (e.g., 4-cylinder vs. V8). In contrast, a full tank of gasoline, assuming a 15-gallon tank (common for many cars), weighs about 90 to 100 pounds (41 to 45 kg), as gasoline weighs roughly 6 to 6.7 pounds per gallon (0.72 to 0.8 kg/liter). Even in larger vehicles with bigger tanks, the engineâ€™s weight far exceeds that of the fuel.
