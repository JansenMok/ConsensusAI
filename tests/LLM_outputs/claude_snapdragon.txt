Snapdragon processors were invented by Qualcomm, an American telecommunications equipment company. The Snapdragon brand was introduced by Qualcomm in 2007, with the first Snapdragon processor (the QSD8250) launching in 2008.

The development was led by Qualcomm's engineering teams, though it wasn't the work of a single inventor. Qualcomm had been working on mobile processors and wireless communication technologies since the 1990s, and Snapdragon represented their entry into the mobile system-on-chip (SoC) market.

The name "Snapdragon" was chosen to convey speed and responsiveness - the idea being that these processors would be quick and agile like the snap of a dragon. Today, Snapdragon processors power millions of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices from various manufacturers including Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and many others.
