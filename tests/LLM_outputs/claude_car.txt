The engine is significantly heavier than the gasoline in a car.

A typical car engine weighs between 300-700 pounds (roughly 135-315 kg), depending on the size and type - smaller 4-cylinder engines are on the lighter end, while large V8 engines can be much heavier.

In contrast, gasoline weighs about 6 pounds per gallon (roughly 0.7 kg per liter). Even with a full tank - say 15-20 gallons in a typical car - you're only looking at about 90-120 pounds of gasoline.

So the engine typically weighs 3-6 times more than a full tank of gas, making it one of the heaviest single components in the vehicle.
